Project Title: ResumeAI – AI-Powered Resume Builder

Overview:
ResumeAI is a system that automatically generates a customized resume or CV tailored to any given job posting. It combines your personal career data with the power of Large Language Models to produce targeted resumes that highlight the most relevant aspects of your experience. The system uses a knowledge graph to store your professional history, ensuring that the AI has accurate information and doesn’t make things up. If the job posting asks for something that isn’t in your profile, AutoResumeGPT will ask you for clarification rather than inventing it.

Key Features:
	•	Automated Job Description Analysis: Paste a job description or provide a link, and the system will extract the key requirements (skills, experience, education) using an LLM.
	•	Personal Knowledge Graph: Import your LinkedIn profile, past resumes, and answer a brief questionnaire to build a structured profile of your experiences and skills. This serves as the factual backbone for the AI.
	•	Custom Resume Generation: With one click, generate a resume tailored to the job. The content is aligned with the job’s needs and drawn from your actual experience. Two formats supported out-of-the-box: standard 1-page resume and multi-page academic CV.
	•	Interactive Gap Filling: The AI will prompt you if the job requires something not in your profile (for example, a skill you didn’t mention). You can provide additional info and let it continue, ensuring the final resume is complete and truthful.
	•	Multiple AI Models: Works in a free mode using open-source models (no API key required), and can leverage premium AI (like GPT-4 or Claude) for improved results if you have an API key.
	•	Extensible & Private: All your data stays in your personal knowledge base. The system can be run locally for privacy, and the modular design allows plugging in new templates or models easily.

Architecture:
The system is composed of modular components (see the docs/ folder for detailed design docs and diagrams). In brief, it has:
	•	A data ingestion pipeline that transforms your inputs into a graph database.
	•	An AI-powered analyzer that understands job postings.
	•	A resume builder engine that queries your data and calls an LLM to create the resume text.
	•	A feedback loop mechanism to interact with you for any missing info.

Getting Started:
	1.	Setup – Clone the repository, install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt). Ensure you have Neo4j running (or use the provided docker-compose.yml to start a Neo4j instance).
	2.	Configure – Rename config.example.yaml to config.yaml. Put your OpenAI/Anthropic API keys if you have them (optional). Set the Neo4j connection string if needed.
	3.	Run – Start the application server: python app.py (this will launch a local web server by default).
	4.	Use – Open the web interface (or use the API via curl/postman):
	•	Upload your profile data (LinkedIn JSON or fill the form). The app will confirm once your profile is saved.
	•	Enter a job description (or URL) and choose the format (Resume or CV).
	•	Click “Generate Resume”. Wait a few moments as the AI works. If additional info is needed, you’ll be prompted on screen.
	•	Download your tailored resume and review it. You can fine-tune by editing directly or adjusting your profile and regenerating.

Repository Structure:
	•	ingestion/ – code for parsing input data (LinkedIn, resumes, Q&A).
	•	knowledge_graph/ – code for managing the Neo4j graph (schema and queries).
	•	models/ – LLM interface code and prompt templates for AI tasks.
	•	resume_builder/ – core logic to generate resumes (orchestrating the flow between analysis, retrieval, and generation).
	•	api/ – web API and application endpoints.
	•	templates/ – resume templates or example outputs for reference.
	•	docs/ – additional documentation and design specs.

Technical Specifications:
AutoResumeGPT is built with Python and integrates with Neo4j for the knowledge graph and can use various LLMs for text generation. By default, it uses an open-source model (running via libraries like Hugging Face Transformers or LangChain), but it can call external APIs if configured. The system ensures that no unsupported data leaves the system – if using local mode, your data and the AI model run on your machine. When using external APIs, only the necessary prompt (job requirements + relevant profile snippets) is sent to the AI provider.

The LLM prompts are carefully constructed to maximize relevance and minimize the chance of the AI going off-track. We employ retrieval-augmented generation ￼ by feeding the model with retrieved facts from your profile. The knowledge graph approach ￼ helps in maintaining an accurate alignment between what the job wants and what you have done, which is the core of this system.

Future Plans:
	•	Add a cover letter generation feature using the same profile and job understanding.
	•	Incorporate a library of resume examples to help the LLM with style and phrasing specific to industries.
	•	Explore using vector databases alongside the knowledge graph for semantic search of experiences (hybrid approach combining graph and embeddings).
	•	Continuous improvement of the prompt strategies and possibly fine-tuning an open model on resume writing data for even better results.
